#A RACE BETWIXT FRIENDS!!


*Will Ilana finally win the favor of Abbi?*
*Or will Abbi get the discount of a lifetime?*

*There's only one way to find out! Find a worthy opponent and get to tappin'!*

__How to play:__
-Player One (Ilana) is the "A" key.
-Player Two (Abbi) is the "L" key.

Both players must press their keys repetitively until someone reaches the
finish line!

#Racing Game

The Goal of this project is to create a racing game that consists of two players
contained within two separate tracks. Each player must tap their assigned key
to move their character. The winner is declared when a player reaches the
finish line.

#Technologies Used

This game was created using the following technologies:

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-jQuery
-Bootstrap.


#Existing Features

-Themed after Broad City with CSS
-IT ACTUALLY WORKS! With aid of multiple callbacks and event listeners, players
⋅⋅1. Use separate keys to move their characters.
..1. Can see a winner display in the form of an alert at the end of a game.
..1. Reset the game.


###Changes I'd Like to Implement

-Adding OOP/Handlebars
-If possible, I'd like to make the page responsive.
-Fix glitches that I've caught and others that I wasn't aware of.
-Make the layout cleaner. It's a little busy for my taste, but I also wasn't
incredibly satisfied with my options.
