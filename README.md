#A RACE BETWIXT FRIENDS!!


*Will Ilana finally win the favor of Abbi?*
*Or will Abbi get the discount of a lifetime?*

*There's only one way to find out! Find a worthy opponent and get to tappin'!*

__How to play:__
- Player One (Ilana) is the "A" key.
- Player Two (Abbi) is the "L" key.

Both players must press their keys repetitively until someone reaches the
finish line!

#Racing Game

The Goal of this project is to create a racing game that consists of two players
contained within two separate tracks. Each player must tap their assigned key
to move their character. The winner is declared when a player reaches the
finish line.

#Technologies Used

This game was created using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap.


#Existing Features

- Themed after Broad City with CSS
- IT ACTUALLY WORKS! With aid of multiple callbacks and event listeners, players
  - Use separate keys to move their characters.
  - Can see a winner display in the form of an alert at the end of a game.
  - Reset the game.


###Changes I'd Like to Implement

- Adding OOP/Handlebars
- If possible, I'd like to make the page responsive.
- Fix glitches that I've caught and others that I wasn't aware of.
- Make the layout cleaner. It's a little busy for my taste, but I also wasn't
incredibly satisfied with my options.
